## Purpose

To understand the flow of Blockchain Development by outputting it

## Structure

- npm workspaces
- Hardhat
- SvelteKit
  - UnoCSS
    - Daisy UI
    - Pure CSS Icons

## What I did

- Copy scafold-eth, understand its structure
- Try yarn v3
- Try yarn workspaces

<!--  -->

- hardhat
- vite (react-ts)
  - Chakra UI

<!--  -->

- Web3Modal
- Kuwa Coin (Contract)
- Vendor (Contract)

I was working with React but was curious about Svelte, so I decided to try it.

- Svelte
- Daisy UI

<!--  -->

- TypeChain

- I had made it so that I could connect a wallet with MetaMask or something, but I didn't want to make people install MetaMask, so I implemented a wallet creation function.

## Going on a trip

Okinawa, Fukuoka, Kagawa, Ehime, Thailand...  
3 months passed...

## Revival

I forgot a lot and there seemed to be some breaking changes in SvelteKit, so I decided to rebuild it again.

- I had implemented a Vendor Contract that allows users to buy and sell Kuwa Coins, but it was too much to ask users to get test ETH in advance, so I changed it to a Faucet Contract to disperse Kuwa Coins.

- Migrate yarn \u2192 npm
